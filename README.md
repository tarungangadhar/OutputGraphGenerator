# OutputGraphGenerator

## Requirements

- matplotlib
- numpy
- sympy

## Synopsis

- This GENERALISED CODE is written in python language.
The best recommended IDE to run my code is
Anaconda ( Jupiter Notebook ) since in it all the
libraries are already available and its user friendly.
I am pasting the script here as well as I will be
uploading the python (.py) file as well.
This is a flexible code in which on entering the
coefficients of differential equations of Q(D) and P(D)
the user will be getting the equations of zero input
response, unit impulse response , step response and
the output. Also, the graphs of them are showed there
itself.
This code is limited to differential equations of 1 order
and 2 order .
A very limited number of assumptions and in-built
functions have been used.
The graph which is plotted is taken from the library
sympy and different colors have been used for all the
three different graphs.

## Instructions
 Use the following command and install the necessary packages required
 ```
 pip install matplotlib sympy numpy

 ```
 ## Sample Graphs output for equation 
 ```
 (D+2) x(t) = (3D +5) r(t)
 ```
